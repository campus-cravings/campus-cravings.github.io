## Overview

### The problem
Since University of Hawaii at Manoa's campus has a variety of food vendors, it can be difficult for students and staff to keep up with what's available. Many of the locations on campus have different choices, depending what they decide to offer on any given day. There is no easy and concise way to track all of these options and their daily menus: Paradise Palms, campus center, food trucks, etc.

### The solution
The Campus Cravings app aims to solve this problem by providing an up-to-date resource on everything food related at UH Manoa. Our completed product will allow vendors to create online menus detailing when and where certain dishes will be avaliable. Students will be able to view the food avaliable in the moment as well as browse the top picks of the day.

### Landing page

![](images/m1-landing-page.jpg)

The landing page is presented to users when they first visit the site. This page is meant to capture the user's attention. The banner consists of a large Campus Cravings logo with a picture of delicious poke bowls as the background.

## Developer Guide

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to [https://github.com/campus-cravings/campus-cravings](https://github.com/aklum3/digits), and download the repo to your local file system (GitHub Desktop).

Third, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/master/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is a sample output:
*(Note that the output will actually be much longer and include all the data from private/data.json)*
```
meteor npm run start

> meteor-application-template-react@ start C:\Users\johndoe\Documents\GitHub\campus-cravings\app
> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

You will also get the following message when you run this application:

```
Note: you are using a pure-JavaScript implementation of bcrypt.
While this implementation will work correctly, it is known to be
approximately three times slower than the native implementation.
In order to use the native implementation instead, run

  meteor npm install --save bcrypt

in the root directory of your application.
```

On some operating systems (particularly Windows), installing bcrypt is much more difficult than implied by the above message. Bcrypt is only used in Meteor for password checking, so the performance implications are negligible until your site has very high traffic. You can safely ignore this warning without any problems during initial stages of development.

Intermittently, you may see the following error message in the console when the system starts up:

```
MongoError: not master and slaveOk=false
     at queryCallback (/Users/philipjohnson/.meteor/packages/npm-mongo/.3.1.1.1mmptof.qcqo++os+web.browser+web.browser.legacy+web.cordova/npm/node_modules/mongodb-core/lib/cursor.js:248:25)
     at /Users/philipjohnson/.meteor/packages/npm-mongo/.3.1.1.1mmptof.qcqo++os+web.browser+web.browser.legacy+web.cordova/npm/node_modules/mongodb-core/lib/connection/pool.js:532:18
     at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:131:7)
     at process._tickDomainCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:218:9)
```

While irritating, this message appears to be harmless and [possibly related to a race condition between the development instance of Mongo and Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9026#issuecomment-330850366). By harmless, I mean that in most cases, the console goes on to display `App running at: http://localhost:3000/` and no problems occur during run time.

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/master/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the imports/ directory with:

```
meteor npm run lint
```
